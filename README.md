##R_tips##

These are some tips (and tricks, with the occasional _hint_ stirred in...) for the computering environment **"R"**.



#1: fivenum() is a convenient way to display the min, lower quartile, mean, upper quartile, and max of a set.
#2: vioplot() for "violin plot" is a more visually appealing alternative to the traditional boxplot().  See package "vioplot".
#3: stackpoly() is more effective than polygon() for filling in sections of plots.
